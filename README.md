# 🚀 Nexora – AI-Powered Website Knowledge Assistant

Nexora is a powerful SaaS application that allows users to input a website URL, automatically scrape the website's textual content, train an AI model on it, and interact with the model through a smart Q&A interface. Think of it as ChatGPT trained on *your* website.

## 🧠 What It Does

1. **Scrape Website Content**  
   Users provide a link to a public website, and Nexora extracts the readable text content.

2. **Train a Custom AI Model**  
   The scraped content is processed and embedded using language models to create a contextual knowledge base.

3. **Ask Anything**  
   Users can then ask questions related to the website, and Nexora answers using the context it learned from the website.
